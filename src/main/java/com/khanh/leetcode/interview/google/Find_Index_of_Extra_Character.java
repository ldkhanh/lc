/**
 * https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/679162/Google-or-Phone-or-Find-Index-of-Extra-Character
 *
 * Position: L4
 *
 * Given two strings, find the index of the extra character that only appears in one of the strings.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "wxgyz", t = "wxyz"
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "bxbbb", t = "bbbb"
 * Output: 1
 * EDIT: Can this be solved in faster than linear time? Bc I know you can easily loop over it/use a hash map but that answer wasnt acceptable
