 * Google | Phone | Solve series of arithemetic equations
 *
 * Given series of arithematic equations as a string:
 * A = B + C
 * B = C + D + 5
 * C = 4
 * D = 6
 * The equations only use addition and positive numbers and separated by newline.
 *
 * Print value of each variable:
 * A = 19
 * B = 15
 * C = 4
 * D = 6
